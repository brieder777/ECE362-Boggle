ECE 362 Mini Project - Boggle
=============================
by Luke Neumann, Brian Reider, and Subhav Ramachandran

## Installation and Use
Rather than putting CodeWarrior project directories in this repository, we should just put our sources here, and include them as necessary in CodeWarrior projects which reside somewhere else.

Cloning/Pulling this repository and dragging the files into CodeWarrior should do this properly (I don't believe CodeWarrior tries to copy the files to its own `Sources` folder).

Later, we should make an effort to clearly separate sources by the projects they belong to.
